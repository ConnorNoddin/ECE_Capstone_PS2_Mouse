# PS/2 Mouse Interface Project

![PS/2 Mouse](images/ps2_mouse.jpg)

This repository contains the source code, PCB design files, photos, and various resources for a PS/2 mouse project. The project is intended to help you create a PS/2 mouse using Arduino and build a custom PCB for this application.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. Arduino C++ Files for PS/2 Mouse (arduino_code)

This directory contains Arduino C++ code for interfacing with a PS/2 mouse. It allows you to read mouse movements and button presses. The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and integrate into your own projects.

### 2. Photos of the PS/2 Mouse Build (images)

![PS/2 Mouse Build](images/ps2_mouse_build.jpg)

In this directory, you can find images of the PS/2 mouse build. These photos can help you visualize the setup and components used in the project.

### 3. PCB Design Files (pcb_design)

This directory contains PCB design files for creating a custom PCB to interface with a PS/2 mouse. You can use software like KiCad or Eagle to open and edit these files according to your requirements.

### 4. Premade Sensor Arduino Libraries (sensor_libraries)

Here, you'll find pre-made Arduino libraries for various sensors that you can use in your PS/2 mouse interface project. These libraries can help you easily integrate sensors with your project, expanding its functionality.

### 5. Saved Oscilloscope Traces (oscilloscope_traces)

In this directory, you can find saved oscilloscope traces used for debugging the PS/2 mouse interface. These traces can be invaluable in identifying and troubleshooting any issues in your project.

## Getting Started

If you're new to this project, follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ps2-mouse-interface.git
   ```

2. Explore the relevant directories based on your needs. The `arduino_code` directory is a good place to start for understanding how to interface with the PS/2 mouse using Arduino.

3. If you plan to build a custom PCB, open the PCB design files in the `pcb_design` directory and customize them for your specific application.

4. To add additional sensors to your project, check the `sensor_libraries` directory for pre-made Arduino libraries.

5. If you encounter issues or need to debug your project, the `oscilloscope_traces` directory provides saved oscilloscope traces that can help you identify and resolve problems.
